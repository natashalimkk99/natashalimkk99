## About Me👋

👋 Hi everyone, I’m Natasha! Welcome to my profile.

I’m currently transitioning into the world of data analytics, bringing along a creative background that helps me look at problems from fresh perspectives. What excites me most about data is how raw numbers can be transformed into clear insights, visuals, and stories that drive real decisions.

## 🛠️ Tools
- SQL
- Power BI
- Excel
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Here’s what I focus on right now:
- Data Cleaning & Exploration → making sure the data is reliable before diving deeper.
- Dashboards & Reports → creating clear visuals in Power BI to make insights easy to grasp.
- Data Analysis → using Python to dig into datasets, run analyses, and highlight trends.
- Storytelling with Data → turning analysis into meaningful insights that add value.

Coming from the creative industry, I’ve learned the power of communication and problem-solving skills I now apply to data. My goal is to continue growing in analytics, and one day, step into a full-fledged Data Scientist role where I can combine technical skills, curiosity, and creativity to solve complex challenges.

💡 I’m always open to connecting with fellow data enthusiasts, sharing knowledge, and exploring opportunities to learn and grow in this field.
